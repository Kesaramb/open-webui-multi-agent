```

The persona will use the `trigger_content_generation()` function!

### Install n8n:
```bash
npx n8n
```

### Access at:
http://localhost:5678

### Import Workflows:
1. In n8n, go to **Workflows â†’ Import from File**
2. Select `workflows/n8n-examples.json`
3. Configure your credentials (social media accounts, etc.)

### Create Webhooks:

The following webhooks need to be created in n8n:

1. **Content Generation**: `/webhook/content-gen`
2. **Social Scheduler**: `/webhook/social-scheduler`
3. **Analytics**: `/webhook/analytics`
4. **Media Processor**: `/webhook/media-process`
5. **Campaign**: `/webhook/campaign`
